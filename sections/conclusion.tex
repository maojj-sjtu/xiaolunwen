\label{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a device-adaptive service composition framework for WoT environment, to avoid the high cost of reusing a BPEL specification between different devices. In the framework, an activity description model is proposed to attach semantic meaning to business activity. After matching and generating, a general service is deployed to provide a unified interface, which achieve the business activity by compositing the device services. So that users only need to interact with the general services during the process execution and should pay no attention to the origin services on the device, which decouple the process specification and the actual device services. 

In the future, we will try to construct a WoT ontology repository to improve our matching performance. Besides, we will extend our framework so as to record the status of executing processes, so that the devices can be replaced dynamically.
